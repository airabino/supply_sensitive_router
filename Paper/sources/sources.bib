abstract = {A new model of centrality is proposed for networks. The centrality measure is based on the “information” contained in all possible paths between pairs of points. The method does not require path enumeration and is not limited to the shortest paths or geodesies. We apply this measure to two examples: a network of homosexual men diagnosed with AIDS, and observations on a colony of baboons. Comparisons are made with “betweenness” and “closeness” centrality measures. The processes by which structural changes in networks occur over time are also discussed.}

abstract = {Battery electric vehicle adoption research has been on going for two decades. The majority of data gathered thus far is taken from studies that sample members of the general population and not actual adopters of the vehicles. This paper presents findings from a study involving 340 adopters of battery electric vehicles. The data is used to corroborate some existing assumptions made about early adopters. The contribution of this paper, however, is the distinction between two groups of adopters. These are high-end adopters and low-end adopters. It is found that each group has a different socio-economic profile and there are also some psychographic differences. Further they have different opinions of their vehicles with high-end adopters viewing their vehicles more preferentially. The future purchase intentions of each group are explored and it is found that high-end adopters are more likely to continue with ownership of battery electric vehicles in subsequent purchases. Finally reasons for this are explored by comparing each adopter group’s opinions of their vehicles to their future purchase intentions. From this is it suggested that time to refuel and range for low-end battery electric vehicles should be improved in order to increase chances of drivers continuing with BEV ownership.}

abstract = {This paper presents a literature review of studies that investigate infrastructure needs to support the market introduction of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). It focuses on literature relating to consumer preferences for charging infrastructure, and how consumers interact with and use this infrastructure. This includes studies that use questionnaire surveys, interviews, modelling, GPS data from vehicles, and data from electric vehicle charging equipment. These studies indicate that the most important location for PEV charging is at home, followed by work, and then public locations. Studies have found that more effort is needed to ensure consumers have easy access to PEV charging and that charging at home, work, or public locations should not be free of cost. Research indicates that PEV charging will not impact electricity grids on the short term, however charging may need to be managed when the vehicles are deployed in greater numbers. In some areas of study the literature is not sufficiently mature to draw any conclusions from. More research is especially needed to determine how much infrastructure is needed to support the roll out of PEVs. This paper ends with policy implications and suggests avenues of future research.}

abstract = {A national network of DC Fast Charging infrastructure (DCFC) corridors can facilitate connectivity and long-distance travel using battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Optimal locations of such facilities are where BEV drivers have easy access to charging where drivers will not have to make any deviation from their pre-planned trips. Such optimally located corridor DCFCs are usually in remote, underserved communities and immediately next to a highway where they lack the advantages of shared utility infrastructure in an urban setting. Therefore, we find that other studies and industry knowledge of infrastructure investments do not apply to corridor DCFC locations. This study evaluates the full project costs of installing and commissioning 54 DC Fast Chargers in 36 sites located in major transportation corridors in California and finds significant variation in costs between them. While existing studies show costs ranging from $20,000 - $150,000, we find costs range anywhere between $122,000 and $440,000. This data is critical for new investment in the U.S. to construct a national charging network of DC Fast charging corridors. We find that a significant proportion of the full project costs are taken up by on site “make-ready infrastructure” costs that vary greatly due to site-specific factors and design choices. DCFC installations should be considered civil construction projects with significant electrical infrastructure planning and installation that requires the cooperation of many local stakeholders. We find that costs can be greatly reduced by working with local electrical utilities early in the design and site selection stages when possible. Our study finds that some cost shift towards utility side costs can greatly reduce overall construction costs for sites along highways. We also find that grid-connected DCFC design are substantially cheaper than off-grid solar powered DCFC with onsite storage.}

abstract = {A review of accessibility measures is presented for assessing the usability of these measures in evaluations of land-use and transport strategies and developments. Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land-use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial–temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility.}

In this essay, I reflect on why progress toward the wholesale adoption of an accessibility-oriented approach in planning practice has been slow, review some of the promising efforts in recent years that suggest that transportation planning may be on the cusp of an accessibility era, and offer thoughts about the power of the accessibility concept as a framework for thinking about the urban environment.}

abstract = {This paper analyses user preferences related to electric vehicle (EV) charging decisions. The analysis includes both a qualitative as well as a quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessment consists of a literature review of existing studies about EV charging behaviour and an analysis of semi-structured interviews with Danish EV users. This assessment identifies the most relevant factors for charging. In addition, it highlights that the time horizon of the charging decision is an essential factor. We use this to design two stated-choice (SC) experiments explicitly taking these findings into account. The first SC experiment looks into long-term decisions related to regular charging practices. The second SC experiment captures decisions related to occasional charging needs on longer trips. The SC data consist of three responses from 558 EV owners for each of the two experiments. We model the data using mixed logit models to allow for unobserved heterogeneity and the repeated nature of the SC data. The main findings indicate a high preference for all-inclusive/flat fee pricing structures. Moreover, they show that respondents value interoperability between charging networks, both nationally and internationally. Related to occasional charging, we find willingness-to-pay measures describing the detour respondents are willing to drive to obtain lower costs, a higher likelihood of available chargers, and facilities at the charging location. Overall the analyses highlight many factors that influence the charging decisions of consumers that are relevant for policymakers and charging operators. In addition, they highlight the barriers in a charging context, such as network roaming, lack of charging etiquette, and congestion at chargers.}

A heuristic approach to deriving idealised charging schedules from over 39,000 week-long travel diaries from the UK National Travel Survey is presented in order to quantify the expected convenience parity — the point at which EV charging and ICEV fuelling are of comparable convenience — for combinations of battery capacity, charger power and access to charging at different locations (home, workplace and public destinations). It was found that although the majority — up to 95% — of individuals who can charge at home are expected to be able to reach convenience parity with battery sizes currently available in EV models at the ‘affordable’ end of the market, this is significantly less likely for those who rely on workplace or public charging — and particularly for those who must rely solely on en route charging. These individuals are expected to suffer considerable inconvenience associated with EV charging relative to ICEV fuelling, and although greater battery capacities and charger power ratings are expected to lessen this inconvenience, there remains a significant gap in the convenience of EV ownership between those who can charge while parked at home and those who cannot. Further analysis is carried out to long journeys that cannot be made on a single charge; ‘range anxiety’ being a major obstacle to widespread EV adoption. It was found that if drivers are compliant with the UK Highway Code in taking regular breaks on long journeys, fewer than 0.01% of trips are expected to be delayed by charging when using battery capacities of 40–60 kWh.}

abstract = {The use of cars in cities has many negative impacts, including pollution, noise and the use of space. Yet, detecting factors that reduce the use of cars is a serious challenge, particularly across different regions. Here, we model the use of various modes of transport in a city by aggregating Active mobility (A), Public Transport (B) and Cars (C), expressing the modal share of a city by its ABC triplet. Data for nearly 800 cities across 61 countries is used to model car use and its relationship with city size and income. Our findings suggest that with longer distances and the congestion experienced in large cities, Active mobility and journeys by Car are less frequent, but Public Transport is more prominent. Further, income is strongly related to the use of cars. Results show that a city with twice the income has 37% more journeys by Car. Yet, there are significant differences across regions. For cities in Asia, Public Transport contributes to a substantial share of their journeys. For cities in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, most of their mobility depends on Cars, regardless of city size. In Europe, there are vast heterogeneities in their modal share, from cities with mostly Active mobility (like Utrecht) to cities where Public Transport is crucial (like Paris or London) and cities where more than two out of three of their journeys are by Car (like Rome and Manchester).}

ABSTRACT = {Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is present all over the United States, but charging prices vary greatly, both in amount and in the methods by which they are assessed. For this paper, we interpret and analyze charging price information from PlugShare, a crowd-sourced EV charging data platform. Because prices in these data exist in a semi-structured textual format, an ad hoc text mining approach is used to extract quantitative price information. Descriptive analytics of the processed dataset demonstrate how the prices of EV charging vary with charging level (Direct Current Fast Charging versus Level 2), geographic location, network provider, and location type. Our research indicates that a great deal of diversity and flexibility exists in structuring the prices of EV charging to enable incentives for shaping charging behaviors, but that it has yet to be widely standardized or utilized. Comparisons with estimates of the levelized cost of EV charging illustrate some of the challenges associated with operating and using these stations.},

Data from a survey of all car-owning households in California are combined with data on public PEV charging and PEV registrations to estimate a structural equation model to test the direct and indirect effects of public charging density on whether participants see charging infrastructure and whether they have considered acquiring a PEV. We also explore the direct and indirect effects of seeing public charging on PEV purchase consideration. Results show the density of public charging is neither directly nor indirectly related to whether people see public charging or their level of PEV purchase consideration. Our results suggests that for public charging to drive PEV sales growth, it may need to be accompanied by strategies to increase consumers’ engagement with PEVs.}

Self-Congruity theory proposes that products are preferred whose symbolic meanings are congruent with personal identity. Further, Construal Level theory suggests that only those who are psychologically close to a new product category through direct experience with it can make concrete construals related to their lifestyles; most drivers lack this for EVs. For instance, potential performance benefits of EVs might offset range limitations for consumers who have such direct experience. The effect of direct experience was tested in a randomised controlled trial with 393 mass-market consumer drivers. An experimental group were given direct experience of a modern battery electric vehicle (BEV), and a control group an equivalent conventional car. Despite rating the performance of the BEV more highly than that of the conventional car, willingness to consider a BEV declined after experience, particularly if the range of the BEV considered was short. The participants willing to consider a short-range BEV were those high in self-congruity, for whom the BEV could act as a strong symbol of personal identity.}

The actual adoption rate however of BEVs in Germany remains low, and strategies for enhancing BEV acceptance are required. Providing direct experience can, for instance, help to overcome prejudices relating to relatively new products, with this being a potential marketing strategy. The present research contributes to the question of what role direct experience plays in acceptance of BEVs. Two studies were conducted to address the relationship between these variables: (1) an online survey (N=286) and (2) a 24-h field test (N=30). Both studies showed several experience-based differences in evaluations of BEV attributes, attitude and purchase intention, with most BEV attributes being evaluated more positively when people had BEV experience. Path analyses revealed a direct experience effect on purchase intention in the online study. Findings from the 24-h field test, showed effects of BEV experience on BEV attributes and attitudes, but no BEV experience effect for purchase intention was found. Based on the results of both studies, we can conclude that practical (and also short-term) experience with BEVs has the potential to change the evaluation of BEVs and psychological factors relevant for determining behavioral intention. As many effects were positive, providing short-term BEV experience to enhance acceptance has the potential to change BEV evaluation as well as the satisfaction with such a vehicle and might be a promising strategy for promoting BEVs.}

The present research aimed to understand factors relating to individually perceived range satisfaction of battery electric vehicle (BEV) users. Data from a large-scale BEV field trial (N=2) were analyzed. Apart from an initial drop in range satisfaction, increasing practical experience was related to increased range satisfaction. Classical indicators of users' mobility profiles (daily travel distances) were only weakly related to lower range satisfaction (not significant), after controlling for practical experience and preferred coverage of mobility needs. The regularity/predictability of users' mobility patterns, the percentage of journeys not coverable because of range issues, and users’ individual comfortable range accounted for variance in range satisfaction. Finally, range satisfaction was related to key indicators of general BEV acceptance (e.g., purchase intentions). These results underline the complex dynamics involved in individual range satisfaction, as well as its central role for BEV acceptance.}

abstract = {The widespread adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is a crucial element in climate policy for the transport sector. To design effective policies to stimulate the uptake of BEVs, it is essential to understand the barriers and drivers that influence consumers' choices for a BEV. To this aim, we present a computational model named CODEC, a hybrid choice model that estimates the future market share of different vehicle types. The model gives insight into the different effects of technical, financial and other behavioural factors that influence the adoption decision. We included social factors and routine behaviour, which are rarely analysed in other research. We assessed the share in sales of BEVs and gasoline vehicles in the Netherlands between 2020 and 2030 for privately owned new cars. To initialize the model we used data from a survey on the perceptions of prospective car buyers (n=1522). Our analysis shows that the BEV market share in new car sales will be between 26 and 40% in 2030, well below the government target of 100%. The analysis also shows that current barriers for BEV adoption: higher purchase price and lower driving range, will become less important over time. In 2030 routine purchasing behaviour and social factors are the main barriers for widespread BEV adoption. New policy measures are needed to lower these barriers. Factors that affect BEV adoption positively have a relatively small effect, so also measures to reduce the attractiveness of gasoline vehicles should be considered.}

abstract = {A sustainable transition towards a net zero emission economy is a primary goal of climate change mitigation. Such a transition should involve each socio-technical system, including the transport system. Adopting a multi-level perspective, the present study explores the behaviour of actors within the road passenger transport sector by investigating roadblocks to the shift towards electric mobility. The study focuses specifically on regime actors, i.e. the whole of consumers (car drivers), industry actors (car manufacturers, suppliers), policymakers, and civil society (citizens, workers, trade unions, environmental organisations, NGOs) acting at regime level. Although these actors provide stability to the socio-technical system, they do not always oppose change. Indeed, they can actively support the transition pushing a reform agenda that fits their interests. The reframing of their behaviour becomes therefore essential for the regime change to occur. The analysis involved the systematic literature review of studies concerning the road transport regime actors. These included 44 publications related to the European continent in the period 2015–2020. The findings reveal a recent re-orientation of regime actors, with the presence of factors supporting change along with those reinforcing resistance. The firsts include the role of electric vehicles as symbols of social status and innovativeness, their environmentally sound for decarbonising transport, and the possibility for firms to pursue new business opportunities and models. In contrast, the emerged factors of resistance include uncertainty in demand and production scalability, the risk of job losses, the rigid value chain, and the lack of charging stations that makes electric vehicles not suitable in everyday life.}

abstract = {Increasing electrification of the global transport system is critical in the transition towards a net zero economy. While electric vehicle (EV) uptake is increasing in many countries, some nations – like Australia – are EV laggards. Here we analyse the stated preferences towards EVs of a representative sample of 500 Australian consumers by estimating a mixed logit model, which will help inform policy-makers in similar markets on how to potentially accelerate uptake. Additionally, the findings of this study are useful to EV manufacturers in exploring the specific vehicle features that are most attractive to consumers, and that are likely to be required to stimulate uptake in car-dependent markets, like Australia, with longer distances between urban areas. The attributes examined in this study include purchase price, driving range, fast charging time, public fast charger availability, financial incentives, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities. As one of the first consumer preference studies to include V2G capabilities, this study also aims to understand how broader potential energy benefits stemming from EV ownership are perceived by consumers, and whether these features could further stimulate uptake. As expected, purchase price, driving range, fast charging time, public fast charger availability and financial incentives in the form of energy bill discounts were found to be significant factors affecting the choice to purchase an EV. Interestingly, the availability of V2G was found to have a significant impact on consumer choice, with consumers’ marginal willingness-to-pay for these features ranging from AUD 2,319 to AUD 5,346, depending on the technical details of its implementation. As identified in other studies, younger consumers were found to be more likely to purchase an EV, and higher levels of EV awareness also have a significant positive impact.}

In this study, we analyze VMT of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) to understand PEV use and the factors that influence their use in a household. We use data from a unique repeat survey of PEV owners in California who were originally surveyed when they first bought their vehicle. Having two survey responses per household allows us to obtain more reliable VMT data and analyze the change in VMT over the vehicle ownership period. The results show that PEV VMT is correlated with traditional factors like population density, built environment, attitudes towards technology, and lifestyle preferences. Specific to PEVs, electric driving range and access to infrastructure, have a major influence on PEV VMT. Moreover, while lower electricity price at home may lead to a higher share of PEV VMT in total household VMT, we do not identify the presence of “rebound effect”. Overall, we observe that factors influencing PEV VMT are like those observed for conventional gasoline vehicles. We find that PEVs drive a similar amount as conventional vehicles, not less (due to range anxiety) as some have suggested. The results have implications for emissions impact assessments and travel demand models that depend on assumptions of average annual VMT for policymaking.}

The results show that battery state of charge (SOC) and the ability to reach the next station without deviating from the original plan are the primary factors influencing charging decisions. Charging cost, time, the detour time to reach a station, and the amenities are statistically significant predictors, but less important than SOC and the ability to complete the trip as planned. The comparison of the SDCMs and DDCMs shows that SDCMs have better goodness-of-fit than more complicated DDCMs. By comparing the relative size of the coefficient, we estimated the monetary value of increasing charging power, moving the charging stations closer to highway exits, and having amenities such as restrooms, restaurants, and Wi-Fi at the charging stations.}
